                <h3><b><em>Introduction</em></b></h3>
                <p>Joanne Rowling  born 31 July 1965), better known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British novelist, screenwriter, producer, and philanthropist. She is best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series, which has won multiple awards and sold more than 500 million copies,[2][3] becoming the best-selling book series in history.[4] The Harry Potter books have also been the basis for the popular film series of the same name, over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts[5] and was a producer on the final films.[6] She has also written under the pen name Robert Galbraith.

Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990.[7] The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written five books for adult readers: The Casual Vacancy (2012) and—under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith—the crime fiction Cormoran Strike series, which consists of The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014), Career of Evil (2015), and Lethal White (2018).[8]

Rowling has lived a "rags to riches" life in which she progressed from living on benefits to being the world's first billionaire author.[9] She lost her billionaire status after giving away much of her earnings to charity, but remains one of the wealthiest people in the world.[10] She is the UK's best-selling living author, with sales in excess of £238 million.[11] The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at £600 million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK.[12] Time named her a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year, noting the social, moral, and political inspiration she has given her fans.[13] In October 2010, Rowling was named the "Most Influential Woman in Britain" by leading magazine editors.[14] She has supported multiple charities, including Comic Relief, One Parent Families, and Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain, as well as launching her own charity, Lumos.</p>

                    Rowling's sister Dianne[7] was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old.[24] The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four.[32] As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories which she frequently read to her sister.[1] Aged nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales.[24] When she was a young teenager, her great-aunt gave her a copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels.[33] Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling read all of her books.[34]

Rowling has said that her teenage years were unhappy.[25] Her home life was complicated by her mother's diagnosis with multiple sclerosis[35] and a strained relationship with her father, with whom she is not on speaking terms.[25] Rowling later said that she based the character of Hermione Granger on herself when she was eleven.[36] Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia which she says inspired a flying version that appeared in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.[37] Like many teenagers, she became interested in rock music, listening to the Clash,[38] the Smiths, and Siouxsie Sioux, adopting the look of the latter with back-combed hair and black eyeliner, a look that she would still sport when beginning university.[39]

                        As a child, Rowling attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More.[40][41] Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus Dumbledore.[42] She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother worked in the science department.[26] Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as "not exceptional" but "one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English".[25] Rowling took A-levels in English, French and German, achieving two As and a B[27] and was head girl.[25]

In 1982, Rowling took the entrance exams for Oxford University but was not accepted[25] and earned a BA in French and Classics at the University of Exeter.[43][44][45] Martin Sorrell, a French professor at Exeter, remembers "a quietly competent student, with a denim jacket and dark hair, who, in academic terms, gave the appearance of doing what was necessary".[25] Rowling recalls doing little work, preferring to read Dickens and Tolkien.[25] After a year of study in Paris, Rowling graduated from Exeter in 1986.[25] In 1988, Rowling wrote a short essay about her time studying Classics titled "What was the Name of that Nymph Again? or Greek and Roman Studies Recalled"; it was published by the University of Exeter's journal Pegasus.[46]

                            After working as a researcher and bilingual secretary in London for Amnesty International,[47] Rowling moved with her then boyfriend to Manchester,[24] where she worked at the Chamber of Commerce.[27] In 1990, while she was on a four-hour-delayed train trip from Manchester to London, the idea for a story of a young boy attending a school of wizardry "came fully formed" into her mind.[24][48]

When she had reached her Clapham Junction flat, she began to write immediately.[24][49] In December, Rowling's mother, Anne, died after ten years suffering from multiple sclerosis.[24] Rowling was writing Harry Potter at the time and had never told her mother about it.[18] Her mother's death heavily affected Rowling's writing,[18] and she channelled her own feelings of loss by writing about Harry's own feelings of loss in greater detail in the first book.[50]
